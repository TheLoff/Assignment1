 git log -- .gitignore

Allows for multiple people to work on the same or different problems
of the main code at the same time without having to wait. "In parallel"

Allows code to be tested and verified by others before merging code 
together.

Git Log is list of actions (commits) performed. 

Git status shows the state of any directory including all branches. Including
where the head is, differences

//Displays paths that have differences between the index file and the current HEAD commit, paths that have differences between the working tree and the index file//

(h)

Inheritance - a derived class receiving data and methods from it's ancestors starting with the base class. Some languages allow for multiple inheritance where child classes
can receive methods/data from multiple classes - Java allows this. C++ doesn't.

Polymorphism - the ability of a child class to take methods from a parent class and apply
new definitions. They can share the same header, but perform different calculations or actions depending on the class - this can be done via overloading or overwriting the method. 

Encapsulation - Specific data is paired with specific methods that operate on said
data within its own class.  Allows for modular programs with specialized operations
that can be reused. 


(i)  Integration management, the manager pulls and reconciles conflicts from
the developers public repository when branches of code are merged. 

In the Dictator/LT format the developers work is pushed to LT's who do some conflict resolution, and then pushed to the Dictator for final approval. 

(j)  There is no managerial hierarchy in a centralized workflow to give structure to operations.  Instead any worker will be competing for their vision of how to resolve a conflict which will lead to disruption to planning, the actual code, and issues between 
employees.
